# Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) â€“ Baseball Season Simulation

This WBS outlines major project components and task groupings, structured according to deliverables required in the repository for simulation, collaboration, and documentation.

---

## 1. Functional Code Development
- 1.1 Implement core Monte Carlo simulation logic
- 1.2 Create functions for calculating win probabilities
- 1.3 Build modular scripts for loading data and running simulations
- 1.4 Validate correctness of outputs and edge cases

## 2. Data Integration (`data/`)
- 2.1 Collect cleaned team schedule files
- 2.2 Extract team-level statistics (OPS, ERA, etc.)
- 2.3 Verify consistency and accuracy of data formats

## 3. Project Documentation & PM Artifacts

### 3.1 Functional Specs
- 3.1.1 Define simulation use case and MVP scope
- 3.1.2 Document core functions, inputs/outputs, and assumptions

### 3.2 Work Breakdown Structure
- 3.2.1 Define project phases and task breakdown (this file)

### 3.3 Product Backlog
- 3.3.1 List of planned features, enhancements, or issues
- 3.3.2 Assign priorities and ownership

### 3.4 Status Log
- 3.4.1 Log weekly progress, blockers, and major decisions
- 3.4.2 Track submission or meeting dates

### 3.5 Activity List
- 3.5.1 Timestamped record of task completions and assignments
- 3.5.2 Grouped by functional, data, or documentation focus

### 3.6 Roadmap
- 3.6.1 Timeline view of planned work (e.g., by week or sprint)
- 3.6.2 Include deadlines for simulation completion, results, and documentation

## 4. Results
