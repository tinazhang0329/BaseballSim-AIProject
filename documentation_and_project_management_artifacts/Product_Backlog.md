#  Product Backlog Management Process â€“ Baseball Season Simulation

This document outlines how the team manages its product backlogâ€”a prioritized list of features, bugs, and technical tasksâ€”for the Baseball Season Simulation project.

---

## ðŸ“‹ 1. What Is the Product Backlog?

The product backlog is a **living document** that organizes and prioritizes all known work items, including:

- **Features**: New capabilities, user-facing functionality (e.g., game simulation, result visualization)
- **Bugs**: Known defects, errors, or broken functionality
- **Technical Tasks**: Internal maintenance, refactoring, tests, or tool integration

All items are documented, reviewed regularly, and updated based on project needs and feedback.

##  2. Structure of a Backlog Item

Each backlog entry should contain:

- **Title**
- **Type**: Feature / Bug / Technical Task
- **Priority**: High / Medium / Low
- **Status**: To Do / In Progress / Completed
- **Owner**: Team member responsible
- **Description**: A short explanation of the task or issue
- **Date Created / Last Updated**

Example (Markdown Table Format):

| Title                     | Type         | Priority | Status      | Owner  | Description                          | Last Updated |
|--------------------------|--------------|----------|-------------|--------|--------------------------------------|---------------|
| Add win probability func | Feature      | High     | In Progress | Tina   | Implements formula for match outcome | 2025-05-22    |
| Refactor sim loop        | Technical    | Low      | Completed   | Ying   | Simplify Monte Carlo code structure  | 2025-05-18    |

##  3. Prioritization Guidelines

Backlog items are prioritized using these criteria:

- **Critical dependencies** (e.g., blocking features or bugs)
- **Impact on user outcomes or team progress**
- **Effort required versus value added**
- **Deadlines or project phase alignment**

High-priority items are tackled early in the simulation cycle.

---

## 4. Update & Review Cadence

- Backlog is reviewed at least **twice per week**
- New items are added after reviews, meetings, or discoveries
- Team members should update item statuses as work progresses

---

##  5. Completion Criteria

An item is considered **completed** when:

- It is fully implemented or resolved
- It passes tests and/or peer review (if applicable)
- It has been pushed to the repository with documentation
