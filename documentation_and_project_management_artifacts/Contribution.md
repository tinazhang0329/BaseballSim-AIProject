# Team Collaboration and AI Usage – Baseball Season Simulation

This document summarizes how team members Tina and Ying Wang collaborated to complete the baseball simulation project, including the use of AI tools in both documentation and technical development.

---

## 👥 Team Members

- **Tina** – Lead on data integration and simulation testing  
- **Ying Wang** – Lead on Monte Carlo simulation code and documentation structure

---

## ⚙️ Project Scope

The team built a Monte Carlo simulation to estimate season win totals for two baseball teams based on real stats and schedule data. The repository includes:

- Cleaned CSV data files
- Functional simulation code
- Structured documentation and project management artifacts

## 🤖 How AI Was Used

Both Tina and Ying Wang used AI responsibly as a **co-developer** throughout the project in the following ways:

### 📌 1. Code Support

- AI was used to help generate simulation functions (e.g., `calculate_win_probability`, `simulate_season`)
- AI provided debugging help and suggestions for performance improvement
- AI offered templates for unit and integration tests

### 📌 2. Documentation Assistance

- Functional specs, backlog process, and WBS were drafted using AI-generated outlines
- Markdown files for documentation folders were generated with AI assistance
- AI helped rephrase and organize collaborative writing for consistency and clarity
