# ⚾ Monte Carlo Baseball Season Simulation

This project uses Monte Carlo simulation to estimate season win totals for Major League Baseball teams based on real-world schedule and performance data. The simulation calculates game-by-game win probabilities using team-level statistics and runs thousands of full-season iterations to generate a distribution of expected wins.

## 🚀 How It Works

1. Load team-level stats (e.g., OPS, ERA) and 2025 schedule data
2. Calculate win probabilities for each game based on team strength
3. Simulate thousands of full seasons
4. Output win distributions and summary statistics
