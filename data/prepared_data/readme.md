# Cleaned Data

This folder contains cleaned and normalized CSV files, ready for use by the Pitch-by-Pitch Pro simulation engine.

## About

- Files are generated by the `data_prepper` module.
- Naming convention: `{team}_{table}_clean.csv` (e.g., `cubs_standard_batting_clean.csv`).
- Data has been standardized for player names, handedness, positions, and more.

## Usage

Use these files as input for simulation and analysis.  
Do not edit these files directly; regenerate them by running the data prepper pipeline.
