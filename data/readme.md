# Data Directory

This folder contains all raw and processed data files used by the Pitch-by-Pitch Pro simulation project.

## Structure

- **baseball-reference.com/**  
  Raw CSV exports and reference documentation for the 2025 Chicago Cubs and Chicago White Sox, sourced from [Baseball-Reference.com](https://www.baseball-reference.com/).
  - Each team has its own subfolder (e.g., `2025 Chicago Cubs/`, `2025 Chicago WhiteSox/`).
  - Includes tables such as batting, pitching, fielding, roster, and schedule data.
  - See `data/encyclopedia.md` for a detailed description of each table and variable.

- **prepared_data/**  
  Contains cleaned and normalized CSVs, ready for use by the simulation engine.
  - Files are named using the pattern: `{team}_{table}_clean.csv` (e.g., `cubs_standard_batting_clean.csv`).
  - These files have been processed to standardize player names, handedness, positions, and other variables.

- `/internal_modules/data_prepper` — Go module for data cleaning and normalization.
- `/code/simulation` — (Planned) Simulation engine code.

## Data Source

All baseball statistics and roster/schedule data were sourced from [Baseball-Reference.com](https://www.baseball-reference.com/).

## Notes

- Do not edit files in `prepared_data/` directly; they are generated by the data_prepper module.
- Cleaned CSVs and team totals CSVs **do not include any stat family/sub-header rows** (such as `,,,Standard,Standard,...`). Only the real column header and data rows are present.
- **All cleaned files include columns for handedness, eligible positions, position flexibility, and dummy variables for each position.**
- For a full data dictionary and table explanations, see [`data/encyclopedia.md`](encyclopedia.md).
